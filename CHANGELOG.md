- [Simulator] Mat prefab includes a new mat type `Gesundroid`.

### Changed

- [BLE] iOS BLE Plugin now supports XCode 13.
- [WebGL] Update WebGL template `webble` for Unity 2020. The old template is renamed as `webble.unity2019`.
- [General] Unity tags used by toio SDK for unity are changed to `t4u_Cube`, `t4u_Mat`, `t4u_StandardID` and `t4u_Magnet`, to avoid potential conflits with users' codes.
- [Sample] Sample_Sensor updated with new Cube features.
- [Simulator] Optimize command processing logic.
- [Simulator] Change the shape of "LED" on the Cube prefab.
- [Simulator] Regenerate octave audio clips for Unity 2020.
- [Cube] Method `RequestSensor` is deprecated. Please use `RequestMotionSensor` instead.

### Removed

- [CubeHandle] Remove deprecated members (`CenterX`, `CenterY`, `SizeX`, `SizeY`, `RangeX`, `RangeY`). Please use `borderRect` or `SetBorderRect` instead.

## [1.3.1](https://github.com/morikatron/toio-sdk-for-unity/tree/v1.3.1) - 2021-08-24

### Added

- [Docs] English documents added.

### Changed

- [Simulator] Camera used by `CubeInteraction` can be assigned from inspector.
(THANKS to contribution from [**zurachu**](https://github.com/zurachu))

### Fixed

- [Simulator] Behaviour of sloped simualtion fixed. The same as real cube, sloped is now set false when cube is upside-down.
- [CubeReal] Add delay after `StartNotifications` at initialization, which otherwise may fail.

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/morikatron/toio-sdk-for-unity/tree/v1.3.0) - 2021-07-29

### Added

- [BLE] Add MacOS BLE plugin. (Thanks to contribution of [Akihiro Komori](https://github.com/comoc))
- [Scanner] Add class `CubeScanner` that integrates `NearestScanner` and `NearScanner`.
- [Simulator] Implement `CubeSimulator.power`, which can be accessed from script or Editor Inspector.
- [Simulator] Implement diconnection and re-connection. Simulator has more similar behaviour as real cube.
- [Simulator] Add sound effects including 'power on/off' and 'conncect/disconnect'.

### Changed

- [Simulator] Simulator's cube object won't disappear when built to mobile device, since new `CubeSanncer` `CubeConnect` require Simulator being able to work under any environment. `CubeSimulator` won't run simulation unless attached to a `CubeUnity` instance.
- [Simulator] Reimplment delay simulation using IEnumerator.
- [Scanner] Replace internal implementations of `NearestScanner` and `NearScanner` with `CubeScanner`.
- [CubeManager] Remove method `CubeManager.SetNearestScanner` and `CubeManager.SetNearScanner` and add method `CubeManager.SetCubeScanner`.

### Fixed.

- [CubeHandle] Not moving backwards on the outside of borders issue fixed.
- [CubeManager] Fix logic of `synced` that is always false after any cube is disconnected. And `syncedCubes` `syncedHandles` `syncedNavigators` now return connected entities only.
- [BLE] Fix Android BLE Plugin disconnection not working issue.
- [BLE] Fix Android BLE Plugin keeping returning characteristics issue.

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/morikatron/toio-sdk-for-unity/tree/v1.2.1) - 2021-04-27

### Added

- [Cube API] Implement method [`Cube.RequestSensor`](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/docs/ble_sensor#書き込み操作). (THANKS to contribution from [**zurachu**](https://github.com/zurachu))

### Changed

- [Simulator] Checkbuttons on inspector for simulating collison and double tap are changed to buttons.
- [Navigator] `Wall` will be created as a line segement rather than a infinite line.

### Fixed

- [Simulator] Make motion sensors' behaviour of Simulator same with real cube.
  - Specifically, change of each sensor will invoke a callback that updates all motion sensors' state in Cube class.
  - Also, `Cube.isCollisionDetected` or `Cube.isDoubleTap` cannot transit from `true` to `false` **UNTIL** **ANOTHER** sensor invokes an update. **This feature may block callbacks**, therefore calling `Cube.RequestSensor` is suggested to manually force an update.
- [Cube API] `collisionCallback` and `doubleTapCallback` will only be invoked when corresponding states transitting from `false` to `true` (i.e. collision or doubleTap just happened). The reason is similar to above that state transition from `true` to `false` does not mean anything but motion sensors' states updated.
- [Simulator.Mat] Fix developerMat number unable to switch from inspector issue.
- [Simulator.Stage] Fix targetPole operation issue.
- [BLE] Fix error of peripheral.disconnect when using iOS plugin.
