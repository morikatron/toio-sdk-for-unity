# 1. Overview

<br>

BLE module group is a group of modules that provide Bluetooth Low Enegy (BLE) communication functions in an abstract manner via an interface.
By implementing all BLE classes through the interface, toio™ programming can be done independently of the communication architecture.
Therefore, it is possible to replace them with communication modules other than BLE by developing new inheritance classes.

#### BLEService

Singleton class as the first window for BLE functionality<br>
<u>BLEService.Instance.SetImplement()</u>Set the internal implementation class by putting the implementation instance in the function.

```C#
public class BLEService : GenericSingleton<BLEService>
{
    public bool hasImplement { get; private set; }

    public BLEService()
    {
        this.hasImplement = false;
    }

    private BLEServiceInterface impl;

    public void SetImplement(BLEServiceInterface impl)
    {
        this.impl = impl;
        this.hasImplement = true;
    }

    public void RequestDevice(Action<BLEDeviceInterface> action)
    {
        this.impl.RequestDevice(action);
    }
    public async UniTask Enable(bool enable, Action action)

    }
    public void DisconnectAll()
    {
        this.impl.DisconnectAll();
    }
}

#### BLEServiceInterface

Interface that serves as the first window for BLE processing<br>
It provides a function to acquire the Device interface that provides BLE function of the operating terminal.

```C#
public interface BLEDeviceInterface
{
    void Scan(String[] serviceUUIDs, bool rssiOnly, Action<BLEPeripheralInterface> action);
    void StopScan();
    UniTask Disconnect(Action action);
    UniTask Enable(bool enable, Action action);
}
```

</details>

# 3. How Communication Works

## 3.1. Search and connect

<br>

<div align="center">
<img width=400 src="res/ble/ble_connection.png">
</div>

<br>

### Search

For an overview of the Scanner class, refer to [here](sys_cube.md#31-search-scanner).<br>This section describes BLE processing of the Scanner class.

The scan roughly follows the steps below.

1. Call the RequestDevice function to obtain the BLDeviceInterface variable.
2. Start scanning for [CoreCube Identification ID](https://toio.github.io/toio-spec/docs/ble_communication_overview.html#キューブの発見).
3. End the scan when the conditions (number of connections, waiting time) are met
4. Return BLEPeripheralInterface variable obtained by scanning

<br>

### Connect

The Connector class is used for the connection. Please refer to the [cube documentation](sys_cube.md#32-connecter), which describes most of the details.

The following points should be added to BLE process.

1. Immediately after Cube variable is created, it calls [Subscribe to automatic notifications (cube.StartNotifications)](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Scripts/Cube/CoreCube/Real/CubeReal.cs) to start subscribing to automatic notifications such as coordinates and buttons.

<br>

## 3.2. Send and Receive

<br>

<div align="center">
<img width=400 src="res/ble/ble_write.png">
</div>
<br>

### Send

The sending call itself is made from a derived class of CubeReal, see [cube documentation](sys_cube.md#4-send-command)).<br>

### Receive

The subscribed information will be automatically notified by [Subscribe to automatic notifications (cube.StartNotifications)](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Scripts/Cube/CoreCube/Real/CubeReal.cs) done immediately after the connection process.
