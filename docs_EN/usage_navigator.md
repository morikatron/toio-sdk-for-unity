# 1. Outline

Navigator is an algorithm designed to help multiple robots (Cubes) navigate well in the presence of each other.
Navigator is an algorithm designed to help multiple robots (Cubes) move well while taking each other's movements into account.

This algorithm is mainly based on two algorithms: "Human Like Collision Avoidance" (HLAvoid) and "Boids" (Boids).

- HLAvoid is a natural way to avoid
- Boids are a herding, synchronized behavioral technique.

All classes implemented in Navigator belong to `toio.Navigation` namespace.

### Class Diagrams

<div align="center"><img width=600 src="res/navigator/arch.png"></div>

Navigator class uses two algorithms, HLAvoid and Boids.<br>
CubeNavigator class inherits from the Navigator class and works with CubeHandle class as an interface.

For details, please refer to [Document describing the functions of Navigator](sys_navigator.md).

### Mode

There are three modes (Navigator.mode) in Navigator class.

- AVOID: Collision avoidance only
- BOIDS: Boids only
- BOIDS_AVOID: Combination of Boids and collision avoidance

<br>

# 2. CubeNavigator class API

When the user uses the navigation functions, it is CubeNavigator class, which inherits from Navigator class, that is directly touched.

## 2.1. Enumerated types

```csharp
// Mode of navigator
public enum Mode : byte
{
    AVOID = 0,
    BOIDS = 1,
    BOIDS_AVOID = 2,
}

// Do you recognize others as Boids?
public enum Relation : byte
{
    NONE = 0,   // Do not Boids others.
    BOIDS = 1,  // Boids others, synchronize movement.
}
```

## 2.2. Parameters

```csharp
// CubeNavigator
public bool usePred = false;    // Whether to use CubeHandle predictions.

// Navigator
public Mode mode = Mode.AVOID;

// for Navigator.GetWaypointTo
public double p_surrogate_target = 1;       // In BOIDS_AVOID mode, the influence coefficient of Boids direction.
public double p_speedratio_boidsavoid = 1;  // Effect factor of Boids on velocity coefficient in BOIDS_AVOID mode
public double p_speedratio_boids = 1;       // Effect factor of Boids on velocity coefficient in BOIDS mode
```

## 2.3. Properties

```csharp
public Cube cube{ get; }
public CubeHandle handle{ get; }
public NaviResult result{ get; }    // Save the calculation results

// Properties inherited from Navigator
public Entity entity { get; }   // By oneself
public Boids boids { get; }     // Boids Algorithm
public HLAvoid avoid { get; }   // Avoidance algorithm
```

## 2.4. NaviResult structure

A structure with the results of the navigator's calculations.<br>
It has the following properties

```csharp
public Vector waypoint { get; }     // Waypoint
public double speedRatio { get; }   // Velocity coefficient (from Boids) (default value is 1)
public double speedLimit { get; }   // Upper speed limit (from avoidance) (default value is the maximum value of Double)
public bool isCollision { get; }    // Collision condition

public Mode mode { get; }           // Navigator mode (backup information)
public Vector avoidVector { get; }  // Result vector of avoidance (backup information)
public Vector boidsVector { get; }  // Boids result vector (backup information)
```

## 2.5. Methods

### Get and set up a wall

> Please refer to the samples [Sample_VisualizeNavigator](/toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_VisualizeNavigator/README_EN.md) and [Sample_MultiMat](/toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_MultiMat/README_EN.md).

#### Walls

```csharp
public System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<Wall> Walls();
```

Get the iterator of the wall.

#### AddWall

```csharp
public void AddWall(Wall wall);
```

Add a wall.

- wall
  - Definition: Wall

```csharp
public void AddWall(List<Wall> walls);
```

Add multiple walls.

- walls
  - Definition of: wall list

#### RemoveWall

```csharp
public void RemoveWall(Wall wall);
```

Remove the wall.

- wall
  - Definition: Wall

#### ClearWall

```csharp
public void ClearWall();
```

Remove all walls.

#### AddBorder

```csharp
public void AddBorder(int width=60, int x1=0, int x2=500, int y1=0, int y2=500);
```

If you want to add a border to the mat, the method is to create a wall on the east, west, north, south, and west all at the same time.<br>
When CubeNavigator is instantiated, `AddBorder(70);` is automatically called.

- width
  - Definition: half the thickness of a wall
  - Default value: 60
- x1
  - Definition: x-coordinate of the center of the first wall in the y-direction
  - Default value: 0
- x2
  - Definition: x-coordinate of the center of the second wall in the y-direction
  - Default value: 500
- y1
  - Definition: y-coordinate of the center of the first wall in the x-direction
  - Default value: 0
- y2
  - Definition: y-coordinate of the center of the second wall in the x direction
  - Default value: 500

Using the default values as an example, the x-coordinates -60 ~ 60, 440 ~ 560 and y-coordinates -60 ~ 60, 440 ~ 560 will be walled off and avoided by the navigator.

```csharp
public void AddBorder(int width, RectInt rect);
```

- rect
  - Definition: Border position RectInt<br>
  [Mat.GetRectForMatType](usage_simulator.md#24-method) to get the RectInt for the size of the mat.


### Set up recognizable others.

#### AddOther

```csharp
public void AddOther(Navigator other, Relation relation=Relation.BOIDS);
```

Make it possible to recognize other navigators.

- other
  - Definition of: other Navigator
- relation
  - Definition: void or not void
  - Default value: [Relation.BOIDS](usage_navigator.md#21-enumerated-types)

```csharp
public void AddOther(List<CubeNavigator> others, Relation relation=Relation.BOIDS);
public void AddOther(List<Navigator> others, Relation relation=Relation.BOIDS);
```

Allows multiple other navigators to be recognized.

- others
  - Definition of: other Navigator list

#### RemoveOther

```csharp
public void RemoveOther(Navigator other);
```

Makes it impossible to recognize other navigators.

- other
  - Definition of: other Navigator

#### ClearOther

```csharp
public void ClearOther();
```

Deletes all recognizable targets.

#### ClearGNavigators

```csharp
public static void ClearGNavigators();
```

Clears the `gNavigators` static list with all CubeNavigator.

`gNavigators` is a list to set the others to be recognized automatically when CubeNavigator is newly instantiated.

When CubeNavigator instance is recreated, either call this method to clear it, or each CubeNavigator instance should be set manually with `ClearOther` and `AddOther`.

### Set others to be Boids

public void SetRelation(Navigator other, Relation relation);
```

Set whether other navigators should be Boids or not.

```

Set whether multiple other navigators should be Boids or not.

- others
  - Definition of: other Navigator list

### Updating state

```csharp
public void Update();
```

Update the state of Cube used for the calculation.

In the frame where the navigation is to be calculated, run it once before the calculation.

```csharp
public void Update(bool usePred);
```

### Run navigator.

It integrates the process of calculating the aforementioned waypoints and using the calculation results to calculate Movement, and provides an easy-to-use method.

If you do not want to customize the calculation process, please use this method directly.

#### Navi2Target

    A smaller value will make it spin faster, while a larger value will make it spin slower. This is not an exact rotation time, but a rough guide.<br>
    If the value is less than 200, the system may become unstable.

    A smaller value will make it spin faster, while a larger value will make it spin slower. This is not an exact rotation time, but a rough guide.<br>
    If the value is less than 200, the system may become unstable.
- Return value
  - Definition: Move command [(Movement)](usage_cubehandle.md#22-Movement-movement-structure)
  - Description:

The Movement.reached returned by Navi2Target is judged by the distance to the target, but since there is no clear definition of "reached" in the case of NaviAwayTarget, it returns the Movement of Move2Target that moves to the waypoint.

```csharp
public virtual Movement NaviAwayTarget(Vector pos, int maxSpd=70, int rotateTime=250);
public virtual Movement NaviAwayTarget(Vector2 pos, int maxSpd=70, int rotateTime=250);

Simplified sample code

```csharp
// Calculate the Movement to navigate to the target.
Movement mv = cubeNavigator.Navi2Target(x, y);
// Execution
mv.Exec();
```

Or

```csharp
// Calculate and execute the Movement to navigate to the target.
Movement mv = cubeNavigator.Navi2Target(x, y).Exec();
```
