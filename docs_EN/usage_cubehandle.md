# 1. Outline

Cube class implements the basic functionality as per toioâ„¢ specification.<br>
On the other hand, CubeHandle class makes it easier to move Cube from the program.

CubeHandle instances have a one-to-one correspondence with Cube instances, and are instantiated using Cube.

```csharp
Cube cube = ...
CubeHandle handle = new CubeHandle(cube);
```

The internal structure of CubeHandle class and its interaction with Cube class is shown in the control block diagram below.

<div align="center">
  <img src="res/cubehandle/arch.png" title="CubeHandle Control block diagram">
</div>

Let's go through the information flow.

1. When the state of Cube (coordinates and angle) is fetched into CubeHandle by the Update method, it first enters the prediction module to estimate the current velocity, state after lag, etc.
2. Combine the prediction results with the state of Cube and enter the control method
3. One route passes the user-specified target (coordinates, angle, etc.) to the appropriate control method (e.g. Move2Target), which outputs a Movement and passes it to the Move method
4. Move method receives the Movement output from the Move2Target method in Section 3, or another overload with the user-specified forward and rotation indication values and duration, and converts them to left and right indication values and duration in the same format as Cube. Move method, and pass them to the MoveRaw method.
5. The MoveRaw method has the same input format as Cube.Move method, and doesn't mess with the instruction values, it just stores them in the prediction module, and passes them to Cube.Move method for execution

## 2.2. Movement structure

The Movement structure is a structure that integrates the output of the control methods for ease of use.

### Variable

```csharp
public CubeHandle handle;   // Whose orders?
public double translate;    // Forward speed indicator value
public double rotate;       // Rotation speed indication value
public int durationMs;      // Duration time (ms)
public bool reached;        // Control method complete?
public bool idle;           // Whether this Movement will be executed
```

### Method

#### Exec

```csharp
public Movement Exec(bool border=true);
```

Specify the presence or absence of a border, and execute it by calling Move on the member variable handle.

<br>

## 2.3. Basic method

### SetBorderRect

```csharp
public void SetBorderRect(RectInt matRect, int margin=20)
```
Set the border `borderRect` by RectInt and margin, which represent the size of the mat.

> The RectInt of a mat can be usefully obtained by specifying the MatType in the GetRectForMatType method of the Mat class.

### Update

```csharp
public void Update();
```

Update the state and predict the destination.

This method is a frame that executes methods other than MoveRaw, and must be executed once before executing them.

### MoveRaw

```csharp
public void MoveRaw(
  double uL, double uR,
  int durationMs = 1000,
  Cube.ORDER_TYPE order = Cube.ORDER_TYPE.Weak
  );
```

## 2.4. One-Shot Method

The closed-loop method of CubeHandle class is supposed to be executed repeatedly to reach the goal. Each time the process is executed, Bluetooth communication with Cube is required, so blinking the LED or playing a sound while moving would require too much communication.

The One-shot method is a solution to this problem, as it only needs to be called once to reach the target, thus reducing the amount of communication required to move.
(This is Open-Loop, so there is no guarantee of results.)

## 2.5. Closed-Loop method

The Closed-Loop method is used to reach the specified coordinates and direction of the mat by continuing to execute it repeatedly.

Unlike the One-Shot method, it keeps tracking the target and guarantees results, but it communicates with Cube more frequently, so the transmission volume is higher.
