### Bluetooth Permissions

To connect directly from the Unity Editor, you need to grant Bluetooth permissions to Unity. If you want to connect with a built app, youâ€™ll need to grant Bluetooth permissions to the built app.

From the Apple menu, go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Bluetooth`, click the `+` button, select the app from the list, and then click "Open". (Reference: [macOS User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mchl211c911f/mac))
