# Technical Documentation - Usage - MacBLE

In most cases, you need to build an app to connect to the <b>real cube</b> and check the operation, which takes time.
By using the BLE plugin for MacOS, you can connect directly to the real cube from the Unity Editor without building the app.

This section explains how to connect to the real cube from the Unity Editor on a Mac.
