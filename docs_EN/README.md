# toio SDK for Unity Documentation

## Development Overview

### [1] Setup

1. Prepare the development environment ["Preparation"](preparation.md)
2. Create a new project in Unity and load toio SDK for Unity ["toio SDK for Unity Installation"](download_sdk.md)
3. (Optional)Install BLE plugin for Mac ["How to set up MacBLE"](usage_macble.md)
<br><br>

### [2] Development

1. Check before development ["How to operate Simulator"](development_simulator.md).
2. Create a development folder under the Assets folder ["Script Dependencies"](development_basics.md#1-script-dependencies).
3. Create a new scene and load Simulator's Prefab ["Creating Scenes"](tutorials_basic.md#2-creating-scenes).
4. Create a program by playing it in Unity Editor and checking how it works in Simulator. (A)
5. Connect to real cubes from Unity Editor to check how programs work on real cubes. (B) <br>
([Set up Mac BLE](usage_macble.md) first if using Mac) (Learn how to connect to real cubes from Unity Editor with sample [ConnectType](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_ConnectType/README_EN.md))
<br><br>

### [3] Build

1. Build an app for a smart device and verify that it works on the device. (C)
    - ["iOS Build"](build_ios.md) | ["Android Build"](build_android.md) | ["WebGL Build"](build_web.md)
    - For Mac or Windows 10 build, please refer to [Unity's official document](https://docs.unity3d.com/ja/2020.3/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html).
2. Repeat `(A)` `(B)` `(C)` to brush up the program.

## Sample

### Basics

- [Sample_ConnectType](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_ConnectType/README_EN.md)

  This sample is to check if the connection settings are different between Simulator and the real environment.

- [Sample_Circling](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_Circling/README_EN.md)

  This is a sample to see how the behavior of many Cubes changes depending on the mode of CubeNavigator.

- [Sample_Cross](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_Cross/README_EN.md)

  This is a sample of how to use CubeNavigator to move multiple Cubes with avoiding collisions.

- [Sample_Sensor](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_Sensor/README_EN.md)

  This is a sample that detects each sensor value of Cube and displays it on UI.

- [Sample_Motor](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_Motor/README_EN.md)

  This is a sample of moving Cube using Cube.TargetMove and Cube.AccelerationMove.

- [Sample_VisualizeNavigator](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_VisualizeNavigator/README_EN.md)

  This is an example of visualizing the results of HLAvoid calculation of CubeNavigator and all defined walls.

### Application

- [Sample_MultiMat](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_MultiMat/README_EN.md)

  This is a sample of using multiple mats together as one large mat.

- [Sample_Bluetooth](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_Bluetooth/README_EN.md)

  This is a sample of communicating with Cube by directly using BLE interface, which is a low-level module.

- [Sample_WebGL](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_WebGL/README_EN.md)

  This is a collection of sample web applications that run in a browser.

- [Sample_Scenes](../toio-sdk-unity/Assets/toio-sdk/Samples/Sample_Scenes/README_EN.md)

  This sample handles scene transitions while maintaining the connection with the real Cube and the correlated instance with Cube on Simulator.
