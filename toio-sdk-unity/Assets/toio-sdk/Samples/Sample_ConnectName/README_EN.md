## Sample_ConnectName

This sample collection demonstrates how to connect to a cube by specifying the Local Name.
â€» WebGL forces the use of the browser-specific Local Name selection UI, so this sample collection is not needed for WebGL.

### Sample Collection

- [Sample_Property](./Sample_Property/)

In the Unity editor's properties, set the name in advance and connect to the corresponding cube.

- [Sample_BasicUI](./Sample_BasicUI/)

List the Local Names of the scanned cubes on the screen, allowing the user to select, connect, and disconnect.

- [Sample_UI](./Sample_UI/)

List the Local Names of the scanned cubes on the screen, allowing the user to select and connect; control and disconnect the connected cube.
