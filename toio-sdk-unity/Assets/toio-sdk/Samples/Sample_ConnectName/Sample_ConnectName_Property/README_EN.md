## Sample_ConnectName_Property

This sample sets the Local Name of the cube to connect to in the Unity editor's properties in advance, and connects to it during runtime when it is scanned.

Before play or build:
- Set `ConnectType` in the inspector. For `ConnectType`, refer to [Sample_ConnectType](../../Sample_ConnectType/README_EN.md).
- In the Inspector's "Local Names To Connect" section, you can add the Local Name of the cube you want to connect to. (The Local Name of a simulator cube will be the name of the game object.)

Runtime:
- On startup, this app automatically connects to the cubes specified if scanned.

### Technical Highlights

Start scanning and set the OnScan callback to receive the scan results.

```csharp
new CubeScanner(this.connectType).StartScan(OnScan).Forget();
```

During execution, the scanned peripherals list will be checked, and those with names present in localNamesToConnect and not currently connected will be selected for connection.

```csharp
async void OnScan(BLEPeripheralInterface[] peripherals) {
    // ...

    foreach (var peri in peripherals) {
        if (!this.localNamesToConnect.Contains(peri.device_name)) continue;
        if (this.connectingNames.Contains(peri.device_name)) continue;

        // Connect cube ...
    }
}
```

- You can set the `ConnectType` (whether to connect to a real or simulator cube) in the Inspector. For details on `ConnectType`, please refer to [Sample_ConnectType](../../Sample_ConnectType/README_EN.md).
