This is a sample to see how the behavior of many Cubes changes depending on the mode of CubeNavigator.<br>
Press the [Connect] button to connect and operate Cubes one by one.

You can change the group control algorithm by switching Navi Mode in Unity's inspector.

> The above gif shows the behavior when Navi Mode is set to `BOIDS`.
